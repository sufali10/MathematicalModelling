# Mathematical Modelling

This repository contains documentation and computational solutions for my independent Mathematical Modelling research projects. Each project is organised into its own folder and includes two files, summarised by the following:

- **Computational Solution**: This file contains the Python or other programming language code used to implement the mathematical model.

- **Research Paper (PDF)**: A comprehensive LaTeX document detailing the research project, including the main research question, methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Table of Contents

### Instructions for Use

Each folder within the `ResearchProjects` directory corresponds to a specific project. To explore a project:
1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Review the `solution.py` (or equivalent) file within the folder to view the computational implementation.
3. Open the research paper PDF in the folder to read the full research paper.
